# Code Refactor Starter Code

## This is Week 1 - Challenge 1 - Code Refactor.

This challenge will be about code consolidation and efficiency. By refactoring the code, it will be cleaner, easier to understand and rank higher in search engines such as Google.

## User Story  
AS A    marketing agency  
I WANT  a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines  

## Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN   a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I  view the source code  
THEN I  find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I  view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I  find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I  view the image elements  
THEN I  find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I  view the heading attributes  
THEN    they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I  view the title element  
THEN I  find a concise, descriptive title  

## Changes made:  
Changed html to use semantic tags as opposed to div  
Updated/consolidated css file to be more efficient by creating classes that can be used multiple times as opposed to creating a new class for each item  
Created git repository, published site to https://joebarbone.github.io/challenge-w1_horiseon/
